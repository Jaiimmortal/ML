# ML
Experimenting with Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Python.

Mostly for the datasets I use jupyter notebook, with anaconda distribution of python.

### Libraries used :

  * `scikit-learn` : for purely Machine Learning Algorithms and preprocessing.
  * `gensim`       : for NLP.
  * `keras`        : for deep learning purposes.
  * `tensorflow`   : for keras backend.
  
  other libraries include:
  
  * `pandas`      : for data analysis purposes.
  * `seaborn`     : for beautiful visualizations.
  * `plotly`      : for time series graphs.
